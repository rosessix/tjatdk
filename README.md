# TJAT.DK

This is a program that i wrote for my programmings class, around a year ago (as of 2023).
Tjat is a funny way of saying chat, and as the name suggests, its a chatting website.
Tjat is heavily inspired by discord, for the messaging system and server system.

The exam was something along the lines of "Create a program of whatever", and I was one of the *best* people in my class, I had to challenge myself and show others what I was capable of doing. Therefore I thought to make a program that used a front-end, paired with a back-end.

The front-end is written with Vue's cdn.
As for the backend, I used express.

Most of the design was inspired by discord, and therefore I cannot take credit for that.
